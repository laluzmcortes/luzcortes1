<h1>A Perfect Beginning</h1>
<h2>Blog, Blogging and their Importance</h2>
<p><h2>A way to connect through knowledge sharing
</h2></p>

</div>

<p>Beginning this blog is challenging and offers all of us great opportunities. I invite you all to share important information that could benefit us all and increase our community to spread it's good impact in society.
  <br>
  <br>
<p>Another benefit to having a company and or personal blog is that their content give your customers or readers the confidence to trust in you and your brand as an expert in your particular field. Many times this benefit is overlooked. There are readers at the other end of your blog, whether or not this is your main reason for building one.
<br>
<br>
  Keeping this in mind, you will be able to enforce a stronger brand connection with your readers and hopefully encourage those readers to return to your site for other relevant information or even purchases.
  <br>
  <br>
Blogging is no longer just an individual’s hobby; it has become an influential tool for the businesses of today. It has created an even playing field among businesses, allowing “mom and pop shops” to compete with the Fortune 500 companies. You do not need millions of dollars to maintain a blog; it simply requires someone educated in your field or even willing to do research in order to consistently update and educate your readers.</p>
